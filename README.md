# issuu-cli
CLI helper app for working with issuu frontend code


Set `ISSUU_HOME` environment variable (save it in you .bashrc or .zshrc) with path to where you keep your issuu repositories cloned. For example

    export ISSUU_HOME=~/Dev

To use it, clone and run `npm link`. Once it's publish it will be `npm install -g issuu-cli`.
Afterwards, it's `issuu [command]`, see `issuu -h` for help
